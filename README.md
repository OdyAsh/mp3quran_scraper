## Important Notes
* You should maintain a good internet connection for at least 1 hour (as this is usually the time this app takes to download/edit the audio files and metadata)
* If not all 114 Surahs are downloaded, open the app again, and type the same reciter name and the same **folder name**, the app should skip the downloaded files and download only the remaining Surahs
* You should use the English version of the website, as this app isn't tested with the Arabic version
* It is advised to leave the terminal (black window) open instead of doing other activities, as sometimes the terminal freezes and you don't get any new feedback on the screen unless you press the Enter key
